Popular movies Stage 1 project

The objective of this app is call to www.themoviedb.org site and retrieve (using API rest services):
- Popular list movies
- Top rated movies
- Detail of a specific movie

In order to use this app, is necessary first config the gradle.properties file (or add it if Android Studio doesn't do it automatically) with your API Key obtained at www.themoviedb.org previously (If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key. Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup, fill the form and follow the instructions)

Once you get your own API Key, go to the gradle.properties file, create a new key named API_KEY and then add your API Key value.

If an API key is not assigned, the app will fail and will show a message with the error.

Enjoy!
